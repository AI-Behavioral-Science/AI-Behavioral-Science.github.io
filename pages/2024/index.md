    **Bridging the Gap: AI, Human Behavior, and the Future of Cities**
  abstract: >
    AI is increasingly influencing the dynamics of our cities. From traffic cameras autonomously reading vehicle plates to self-driving cars navigating our streets and intelligent traffic signals optimizing intersections, AI is becoming integral to the fabric of our cities. But how do these AI technologies influence the behavior of city dwellers, and how can we enhance the coordination between AI systems and human activity in these dynamic urban spaces?
    In this talk, the presenter will draw on extensive research and hands-on experience in applying AI to real-world city challenges. Over recent years, she has worked closely with city practitioners, gaining valuable insights into how AI is actually deployed in cities, the significant bottlenecks that exist, and why there is still much work to be done in advancing AI technologies to solve complex urban problems. She will share her observations and discuss the critical innovations needed to make AI truly effective in our cities.

# Overview

Collocated with ACM KDD 2024, the first workshop on *AI Behavioral Sciences (AIBS 2024)* calls for broad discussions on the concept of AI behavioral science, which represents an emerging field that seeks to understand, model, and direct how AI behaves. Critical questions include: Do AIs have personalities? How to describe the patterns of AI behaviors? How to quantify the similarity between AI and humans behaviorally? How to conceal the objectives of AI (rather than generating next words) and align them with the distribution of human objectives? How to model and optimize human-AI collaboration? What are the unique challenges in AI behavioral studies (e.g., sensitivity in prompting)? What is the key difference between AI behavioral science and human behavioral science? Do we need to design new experiment methodologies and measurements tailored for AI? What could be the potential applications (e.g., AI agents)?

The workshop aims to create a collaborative and interdisciplinary platform that brings together researchers from different fields, especially generative AI, data mining, and behavioral sciences to discuss these questions. By fostering an open and forward-looking environment, our ultimate goal is to facilitate discussions on the current landscape of AI behavioral science at large. This workshop provides an opportunity for participants to share insights, exchange ideas, and explore innovative approaches in the field.

<!-- This workshop will be a **non-archival** workshop; we are excited to host this workshop **in person** in conjunction with [**KDD 2024**](https://kdd2024.kdd.org/). Please click [here](https://kdd2024.kdd.org/registration/) for KDD 2024 registration. -->
